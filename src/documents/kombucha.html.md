# Kombucha #

Editors are superheroes. They absorb 95% of directors' crap and look beyond the dull colors to create vivid sequences of stories. Colorists *then* come in and *tells the same stories with color.* 

Employing cutting edge cloud robots, **Kombucha** makes it possible to color correct entire repositories of footage before the editing process.

**Kombucha** has passed my own project testings phase and is now looking for private testers. Starting a Kombucha is easy:

1. Download BitTorrent Sync.
2. Sync folders containing fresh-from-camera materials to a Kombucha server.
3. Kombucha servers can read Final Cut Pro X project metadatas, so if use that sync the events and project folders
4. If you use proxy media instead, just upload them along side, no data will go unused. but do remember to *also* sync the originals, and keep it syncing at night.

Let's make Kombucha!
