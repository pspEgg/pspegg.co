# Kombucha I/O #

Editors are super heroes. They absorb 95% of directors' crap, carefully leaving only the dull colors intact so that the colorist with the Ferrari can work with the most *dynamic range*. 

If you got sick of channeling super powers, you're at the right place. If not, well, go back to editing.

## Spelunking ##

Kombucha is a destructive colour grading I/O service. torrent your gray footage to the cloud and get back spoiled footage. Why would you want to do that? Well that's how Kombuchas are made. Also Walter Murch suggests spelunking before looking at footage. It's a win-win.
